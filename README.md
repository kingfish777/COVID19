Our approach is to apply machine reading to build a knowledge graph to improve our understanding of COVID-19. Purpose of repository is to share tools and resources for applying machine reading to model COVID-19.

* Build preliminary mechanism-level knowledge graph by applying the INDRA machine learning tool to articles with PMCIDs in the CORVID-19 corpus 
* Build preliminary clinical-level knowledge graph leveraging existing computable knowledge resources (SemMedDB and SPLDB)
