COVID19

Our approach is to apply machine reading to build a knowledge graphs of caronaviruses, the family of viruses known to cause COVID-19. The purpose of repository is to share tools and resources for applying machine reading to model COVID-19 at different levels of abstraction, including mechanistic and clinical.

* Build preliminary mechanism-level knowledge graph by applying the INDRA machine learning tool to articles with PMCIDs in the CORVID-19 corpus 
* Build preliminary clinical-level knowledge graph leveraging existing computable knowledge resources (SemMedDB and SPLDB)
